Known bugs:

- Exceeds			There's no real alternative font, shading, colour-scheme etc to meet the final rubric for
					Exceeds. Can't really decide on one either.
- createModal		Needs re-factoring so that the array it uses is global.
- easter egg		When there's an error, there's no way to re-set the page other than by re-loading it.
					This is very poor; there needs to be at least a button or something.
- clearGallery / prepGallery - these functions seem to do practically the same thing. Don't need both!
- DOB format		May need dd/mm/yyyy as well.
