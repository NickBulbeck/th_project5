ADDRESS...



DATE OF BIRTH...


NUMBER TO DISPLAY...


SEARCH BUTTON...
Is supposed to filter only the results on the page. But by submitting the page, the
page re-loads. So, we'll kind of need to prevent default, I'd say. We explicitly DON'T want to refresh the page.

FOTIE NON-DUPLICATE THINGY
Probably need to just create a number based on employee.gender and the id number thing I've created. Maybe a random number between 0 and 3 for each time the screen is updated.
