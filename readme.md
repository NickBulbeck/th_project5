Public API demo project
_______________________

Notes for the reader...

Additional features
-------------------
I've added a select list so that the user can display more than the default 12 employees. There's a small
range of interesting prime numbers to choose from. 
There is a Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy-themed 'easter egg' that is accessed via the Douglas Adams option
on the same select list. It calls a second api to retrieve randomly-generated, but pronounceable, names in the style of Hitch-Hiker characters.
I've gone for a sort of reddish colour-scheme.


Planned upgrades
----------------
The clearGallery and prepGallery functions do almost the same thing and will be refactored. This is what 
happens when you spent too long on a project!
At the moment, the only way to recover from an error on the Douglas Adams option is to refresh the page.
A re-try option will be added.
