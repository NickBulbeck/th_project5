Friday's ToDo:

- Add text to the modal next/prev div to mark full/Search           ToDo
- Fix bug whereby a single search result has an empty prev/next div ToDo
- Shrink the createModal function                                   ToDo
- Change the button text 

FULL/SEARCH...

First, find out if there's a search or not. Think I can do this if search-input.value isn't ''.
Then, set up the text (cycle through search results, cycle through all students) accordingly.
Then create an H3 element or something that looks right, and append it to the right element.
